## Documentation Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minor changes to the documentation, such as grammar corrections and general
> clarifications, can be pushed to the 'master' branch at any time. However,
> documentation related to specific CGNS release topics should only be made
> in the 'develop' branch. Once a CGNS release occurs, those changes can be merged
> into the 'master' branch and tagged in sync with the CGNS library release.

> [!NOTE]
> cgns.org is rendered from the 'master' branch contents.
